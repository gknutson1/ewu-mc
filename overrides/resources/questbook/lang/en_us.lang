nomifactory.quest.db.1.title=Crystal Growth Chamber
nomifactory.quest.db.1.desc=The §3Crystal Growth Chamber§r allows you to perform §bApplied Energistics§r's world crafting recipes inside of a machine. Hooray, you never have to drop more things in water again!%n%nIt is used for growing §6Crystal Seeds§r into §6Pure Crystals§r, and also for creating §6Fluix Crystals§r.%n%nJEI doesn't show the Chamber's recipes directly, so we'll explain it here:%n%nSeeds are made by pulverizing any of the three crystal types and mixing the dust with sand. A seed grows into the corresponding Pure Crystal, which is substitutable for the original crystal in most recipes. Using Pure Crystals lets you effectively double your material efficiency, which is nice. And no, you can't grind down Pure Crystals to further multiply your resources. Sorry.%n%nFluix Crystals you've already had to make in a pool of water by now, and it's the same ingredients here: insert one each of a §6Redstone Dust§r, §6Charged Certus Quartz Crystal§r, and a §6Nether Quartz§r to produce one Fluix Crystal.

# db 4
nomifactory.quest.db.4.title=Iron Supply
nomifactory.quest.db.4.desc=§c§rOres in §5Nomifactory§f exist in large clusters, or '§eveins§f'. These veins are scattered around the world, and are relatively common. The §aScanner§f in your inventory can detect any ore within 16 blocks of you, so digging down and scanning should show you any nearby veins. Try scanning now by holding §6right-click§f until the progress meter completes.%n%nWhile the Scanner requires energy to work, you are unlikely to deplete its battery. That said, the quest book will later guide you towards making a §aFlux Capacitor§f to charge tools in your inventory.%n%nIn order to proceed, you'll need to locate a source of §6Iron§f. You have a few options. §6Magnetite§f veins are higher up and contain large amounts of iron, as well as some §6Vanadium§f and §6Gold§f. Another good source of iron is §6Limonite§f veins, which contain several types of iron. Finally, §6Pyrite§f can be found paired with §6Copper§f in several types of veins.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is obtained simply by §esmelting Iron a second time§f. It has more durability than Iron, so it is better for making tools, but §cdo not convert your entire Iron supply over to Wrought Iron§f. The two materials are not interchangable and you'll need Iron or Wrought Iron as demanded by various recipes.

# db 5
nomifactory.quest.db.5.title=Mining Hammers
nomifactory.quest.db.5.desc=§aMining Hammers§r offer a relatively cheap way to mine out areas much faster. They clear a 3x3 of blocks and mine quickly, so they're absolutely worth investing your first few ingots of metal into§..%n%n§6Stone§f is the cheapest Mining Hammer, but naturally it breaks quickly. Since you have some §6Iron§f already, consider using those on your first few mining expeditions.%n%nThe best Mining Hammers are §6Diamond§f and §6Platinum§f. Other Mining Hammers are also good but wear out more quickly.%n%n§c§nNEVER break GregTech machines with mining hammers!§r%n%n

nomifactory.quest.db.6.title=More Materials
nomifactory.quest.db.6.desc=Before you continue, you'll need access to some more materials.%n%n§6Redstone§f: Found only deep in the world, in massive veins paired with §6Cinnabar§f and §6Ruby§f.%n%n§6Copper§f: Two primary sources. §6Tetrahedrite§f veins are higher up, while §6Chalcopyrite§f veins are lower, paired with some small amounts of §6Iron§f. You'll also find §6Malachite§f inside of Iron veins, this is another type of copper ore.%n%n§6Tin§f: Found essentially at ground level, and almost always detectable by §aScanner§f from the surface. §6Cassiterite§f is another type of tin ore, and they're always found together. If you cannot find a vein of tin, there are small amounts of tin inside veins of §6Aluminium§f and §6Rock Salt§f, which might be enough to hold you over until you find a proper tin vein.%n%n§6Coal§f: Found in relatively shallow depths. §6Lignite Coal§f is just a less pure and less effective form of Coal.%n%n§6Gold§f: Found inside of §6Magnetite§f veins, close to the surface.

nomifactory.quest.db.7.title=Cables
nomifactory.quest.db.7.desc=The most basic cables, such as these §6Red Alloy Cables§f, can be wrapped in their §6Rubber§f insulation by hand.%n%nMore advanced types of cables will require an §3Assembling Machine§f and liquid §9Rubber§f, but you can do it the simple way for now.

nomifactory.quest.db.8.title=The Third Tier Three Circuits
nomifactory.quest.db.8.desc=With three §6Microcircuits§r and some standard components, you can upgrade to the penultimate Tier Three circuit: a §6Microprocessor§r.

# db 9
nomifactory.quest.db.9.title=Ore Doubling?
nomifactory.quest.db.9.desc=In most expert packs, you want to try to process as little ore as possible before you get access to ore doubling. It's a habit most of us pick up.%n%n§eYou shouldn't feel any pressure to do that in Nomifactory, though§f. Ore veins are massive, and mining is extremely fast with §aMining Hammers§f. What's more, even once you get access to §3Macerators§f, they initially process ore slowly and require power to operate.%n%nObvious exceptions would be rare materials or anything you buy with §dOmnicoins §fbecause you can't find it. Those are worth doubling, if possible.%n%nBut at least for now, you shouldn't feel any guilt about smelting the more common ores without doubling them! §eOre doubling can be safely ignored until you have Medium Voltage machines or even later.§r

# db 10
nomifactory.quest.db.10.title=Tier Two Micro Miner
nomifactory.quest.db.10.desc=The Second Micro Miner!%n%nThis uses an §bExtended Crafting§r table so it's not possible to automate the Miner itself with §bApplied Energistics 2§r just yet (this requires more advanced technology not easy to access until the Tier Four Micro Miner). You can make it semi-automatically by prestocking the components you need, and filling up the Extended Crafting Table with §bJEI§r!%n%nThis Micro Miner can get you:§6%n* Bauxite Ore%n* Niobium Ore%n* Copper Ore%n* Tungstate Ore%n* Scheelite Ore%n* Cassiterite Ore%n* Radium Salt§r%n%nAs well as the §6Stellar Creation Data§r, which will be useful much, much later.

# db 11
nomifactory.quest.db.11.title=Electronics Subcomponents
nomifactory.quest.db.11.desc=A "§esubstrate§f" is the "board" part of a circuit board... the backing that the circuit components and wires are laid into. A good substrate needs to not conduct electricity, for obvious reasons. §6Wood§r coated in §6Sticky Resin§r is a primitive but effective material to use as your first substrate.%n%nYou'll also need to make §6Vacuum Tubes§f, as well as some primitive §6Resistors§r. §6Paper§r will work as a material for these, for now.%n%nMake sure to code these recipes into a §3Worktable§r... you'll be making a LOT of these things.

# db 12
nomifactory.quest.db.12.title=Some Starter Tools
nomifactory.quest.db.12.desc=One of the eccentricities of the pack you'll need to get used to is the way the tools are displayed. Most tools can be made out of nearly any metal, and §bJEI§f will display a huge number of options... every combination of every tool with every material. However, the pattern to make the tool is always identical, so §ejust arrange the plates and ingots in the same manner as the examples, ignoring whatever material it says§f. Rods where rods go, plates where plates, etc. The only restriction is that tools §emust be made from all of the same material§f... you cannot mix and match different metals in a single item.%n%nRecipes will default to showing a "§6Darmstadtium§f" tool (or sometimes §6Aluminium§f) of the appropriate type if a tool is required, but the correct type of tool made out of any metal will work. So just ignore the tool's material in the recipes, it can be whatever you'd like.%n%nFor now, make a §aHammer§f (not a §aMining Hammer§f, mind you... six ingots, not five). Hammers can be used to turn §etwo ingots into one plate§f. §6Plates§f can make a §aFile§f, Files can make §6Rods§f, etc. Use JEI to work your way down the list of tools.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is probably your best bet for a tool material right now, but better materials will become available as you progress.

# db 13
nomifactory.quest.db.13.title=Worktables Are Life
nomifactory.quest.db.13.desc=If you try to craft each item on demand, you'll go insane. Use §3Worktables§f to save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. If you're doing things right, you'll likely have §ea dozen or more worktables§f in short order.%n%nLoad up the table's storage area with the necessary materials, and §ebatch-craft§f items when needed. The satisfaction of clicking a few buttons and getting §ea stack of finished items§f crafted up is worth the effort.%n%nEach worktable will remember up to the last nine recipes you made in them, which can be recalled by clicking in the top-right recipe history pane. If you want to ensure a recipe doesn't ever get replaced by a different one, right-click it in the history pane to lock it.

It is made in the §3Alloy Smelter§r.%n%nYou might want to save your §6Coal Dust§r for circuits and use §6Charcoal Dust§r instead. Later, you can also centrifuge either of these dusts or §6Coal Coke Dust§r into §6Carbon Dust§r, which can be used for Steel and other useful things.

# db 22
nomifactory.quest.db.22.title=Pyrolyse Oven
nomifactory.quest.db.22.desc=The main function of this oven is to increase the fuel values of your wood and coal while also recovering some of the various potentially useful waste products.%n%nTurning §6Coal§r into §6Coal Coke§r will not only make it more useful as fuel, but will also produce §9Phenol§r, which you'll need for circuits.%n%nThe Pyrolyse oven is also the source of several other fluids that can be distilled for useful ingredients.

# db 23
nomifactory.quest.db.23.title=Obsidian
nomifactory.quest.db.23.desc=You'll need Obsidian to make Dark Steel. Most of the tools you can make cannot mine Obsidian, but you do have a few potential options for ones that will work. The options you're most likely to have access to at this point are:%n%n1) A Diamond Pickaxe or Diamond Mining Hammer.%n%n2) A Platinum Mining Hammer (not pickaxe though).%n%n3) A Cobalt Pickaxe (smelted from Cobaltite).

# db 24
nomifactory.quest.db.24.title=Steam Dynamo
nomifactory.quest.db.24.desc=Your first major crafting project!%n%nYou'll need a small bit of §6Silver§f for this dynamo. If you haven't found a §6Galena vein§f yet (which is where Silver is), then consider "buying" some §6Silver Ore§r using §dOmnicoins§r. You won't need a ton of silver and lead just yet, so it won't bankrupt you.%n%nKeep in mind that §eDynamos only output power when burning through fuel, and only the block attached directly to the coil will get provided with power§f.

nomifactory.quest.db.55.desc=Note: this quest accepts an LV, MV or HV Centrifuge.%n%n§3Centrifuges§r provide you with 3 tiny piles of additional materials when processing ore dusts (§e9 tiny piles = 1 dust§r). Sometimes it's the main dust, but often it's a different useful material that is otherwise unobtainable.%n%nInstead of washing §6impure dusts§r (made from macerating or hammering ores) in a cauldron, you can get more out of each dust by centrifuging it. The same is true of §6pure dusts§r, when you eventually make a §3Washer§r or §3Chemical Bath§r. Note however that pure and impure dusts will usually give different byproducts (always check in §bJEI§r).%n%nCentrifuges also have other uses like unmixing compound dusts and fluids, or getting §6Rubber Pulp§r, which can be chemically reacted with §6Sulfur§r to efficiently make §9liquid Rubber§r.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.db.56.title=Putting It All Together
nomifactory.quest.db.56.desc=Now that you have everything you need to power your machines, it's time to put it all together.%n%nYour Steam Dynamo needs burnable fuel (like §6Coal§r) and §9water§r. It will output RF power through the Excitation Coil (the red bit at the top). The orientation of the Steam Dynamo can be adjusted with a §aCrescent Hammer§r, if needed.%n%n§6Energy Conduits§r can be used to transfer that RF power, but the dynamo can also output RF directly into a CEF by making the Excitation Coil touch the CEF.%n%nThe CEF transforms RF power into EU, outputting the resulting EU through the side with a red dot. The orientation can be adjusted using a §aWrench§r. Attach your §6Conductive Iron Cables§r to the output side of the CEF.%n%nNow all you need are some §bGregTech§r machines to hook up to the cables! You can make whatever you want, but its recommended that you get these two first:%n%nThe §6Wiremill§r will make crafting wires much, much easier.%n%nThe §6Compressor§r will make Plates from one ingot instead of two.

# db 57
nomifactory.quest.db.57.title=Ender Fluid Conduits
nomifactory.quest.db.57.desc=§aEnder Fluid Conduits§r are the most powerful fluid transportation mechanism offered by §bEnderIO§r.%n%nNot only are these faster than §aPressurized Fluid Conduits§r, but because they teleport fluids instead of flowing them in the conduits, it possible to have a large number of fluids moving through a single line.%n%nIn addition to §aFilters§r they also have multiple channels which can be used to direct fluids through the same conduits to various destinations.%n%nIf you don't want to (or haven't unlocked access to) routing fluids through §bAE§r, these are your best alternative.

# db 58
nomifactory.quest.db.58.title=LV Power Storage
nomifactory.quest.db.58.desc=§6Batteries§r are §bGregTech §rpower storage for §aEU§r energy.%n%nAlthough there are several types of rechargeable batteries you can make, §6Cadmium Batteries§r are the best ones, as they have the most storage capacity. §6Lithium§r is second best, and §6Sodium§r is third.%n%n§6Lithium§r is possible to find inside of §6Tungsten§r veins, however, they are fairly rare. Consider "buying" some Lithium with §dOmnicoins§r.%n%n§6Cadmium§r is so tough to get at this point, its not even worth considering. However, §6Sodium§r is plentiful. You can get Sodium by smelting §6Salt§r, with other options becoming available later.

nomifactory.quest.db.59.title=Copper... Nickel... Cupronickel?
nomifactory.quest.db.59.desc=Nickel comes from several different ores, including Pentlandite and Garnierite, but they're all found in the same vein.%n%nNickel is used mostly for several very important alloys, including Invar and Cupronickel.

# db 60
nomifactory.quest.db.60.title=Blast Furnace Fun
nomifactory.quest.db.60.desc=The §3Electric Blast Furnace§r is a major, major milestone in your §bGregTech§r career. It has the power to smelt more advanced materials. The first of which, §6Aluminium§r, is going to be important in the immediate future.%n%nThere is a diagram of how to build the EBF in JEI. The second and third levels must be a 3x3 square shape of Coil Blocks (§6Cupronickel§r is the only type of coil block you have access to for now) with an empty center.%n%nHowever, the bottom and top layers are very flexible. The §6EBF Controller§r must be on the §ebottom layer§r of the structure, and on the §emiddle of an outer edge§r. Otherwise, you can put the hatches and buses wherever you want, filling in all gaps in each layer with §6Heatproof Machine Casings§r. It's worth noting that you must §euse at least 10 Heatproof Machine Casings in your layout or the structure will not form§r.%n%nThis quest calls for two energy hatches, a fluid input and output, and an item input and output, which is a total of six positions. Their specific order and placement don't matter, as long as you can access them. The seventh position is your EBF controller, leaving eleven gaps to be filled by Heatproof Machine Casings. If you did everything right, the structure will form: the colors on its hatches and casings will unify, and the controller will say "Idling."%n%nYou'll most likely want to locate your power quite near to the EBF. It is very power hungry, and if it cannot get enough energy, progress on the current item smelting will start to regress. Be careful to ensure the EBF has enough power, and keep a Soft Hammer nearby to pause it by tapping the controller if you run out of power.

nomifactory.quest.db.63.title=ME Chest
nomifactory.quest.db.63.desc=The §aME Chest§r is somewhat impractical to use on its own, but it's a necessary ingredient for the much more useful §6ME Drive§r.%n%nThis is a rudimentary digital item storage device. By placing a §6Storage Cell§r inside it, you can access the contents as though you were looking through a chest. You can carry the disk to another location and place it down in a different ME Chest if you want, and the items will come with it.%n%n§cDon't put Storage Cells inside other portable mod inventories like a Satchel, (or vice-versa) as you risk corrupting the contents of the Satchel and the Storage Cell.§r There's technical reasons why this happens (NBT overflow), and it's not unique to these items, but that's not really worth going into.%n%n

# db 64
nomifactory.quest.db.64.title=Digital Storage At Last
nomifactory.quest.db.64.desc=§bApplied Energistics§r uses §6Storage Cells§r as its primary means of digital item and fluid storage.%n%nAll unformatted Storage Cells are limited to at most 63 distinct item types, with the first item of each new type taking up a chunk of the total bytes of cell storage, and subsequent items of existing types taking a small amount of bytes thereafter.%n%nA §61k ME Storage Cell§r is the first and smallest cell for storing items. If you are going to be storing many different kinds of items in your network, you will need to make an §6ME Drive§r and fill it with multiple Storage Cells.%n%nThe §64k ME Storage Cell§r is the next size up. With four times the bytes it holds substantially more items per type, but it requires a more advanced technology than you currently have available: AE §6Processors§r made in an §3Inscriber§r.

nomifactory.quest.db.68.title=Experience Obelisk
nomifactory.quest.db.68.desc=The §3Experience Obelisk§r is a mass storage device for player experience in the form of §9Liquid XP§r.%n%nVia the GUI you can insert or extract levels as needed, as well as configure interactions with neighboring blocks (as is typical of §bEnderIO§r machines).%n%nLiquid XP can also be pumped in directly from your automation such as §3Fluid Extractors§r.

# db 69
nomifactory.quest.db.69.title=Aluminium Ingots
nomifactory.quest.db.69.desc=With your EBF running, start to create a supply of §6Aluminium Ingots§r. These are crucial ingredients for MV machines, including §bApplied Energistics§r.%n%nIf you find your power supply is faltering, you may want to make additional dynamos and turn them into steam boilers and turbines. Upgrading your dynamos is also advisable.%n%nHowever, you're also about to reach MV. You're bound to discover a better power source than steam before long.

# db 70
nomifactory.quest.db.70.title=MV Power Storage
nomifactory.quest.db.70.desc=§aMV Batteries§r function essentially the same as §aLV Batteries§r, only stronger. They also need to be put into an §3MV CEF§r or §3MV Battery Buffer§r.

nomifactory.quest.db.71.title=MV Electrolyzer
nomifactory.quest.db.71.desc=An §3MV Electrolyzer§r allows you to process recipes that require up to 128 EU/t, and can optionally overclock recipes costing at most 32 EU/t.%n%nThis means you can split more kinds of things for useful products.%n

# db 72
nomifactory.quest.db.72.title=LV Assembling Machine
nomifactory.quest.db.72.desc=§3Assembling Machines§r are the linchpin of your factory, gating progression through the §6Circuits§r. %n%nEach time you upgrade to a new voltage of Assembling Machine, you will be able to craft more advanced §ethemes§r of circuits. These use more complex ingredients and require new infrastructure to be in place, but are more efficient to craft overall than the same tier of circuit from the prior theme.%n%nCheck out the §dProgression quest book tab§r to see the flow of circuit progression.%n%nAssembling Machines also open up a plethora of §eequal or more efficient recipes that don't require hand tools§r. Hand tool recipes also don't play nice with §bApplied Energistics§r.%n%nTake advantage of Assembling Machines: §cphase out all use of hand tools for crafting items in your automation going forward.§r Once you have all the important machines, you will never need hand tools for crafting.

# db 73
nomifactory.quest.db.73.title=ME Conduit
nomifactory.quest.db.73.desc=§6ME Conduits§r have the advantage of being able to share a block space with other conduit types. Oh, and they're relatively cheaper to make.%n%nThe only downside is that §ethey will not connect to §bApplied Energistics§r §emicroparts§r like slab-form §6Interfaces§r or §6Level Emitters§r, so you have to use AE cables like §6Fluix Cable§r for those.

# db 74
nomifactory.quest.db.74.title=Aluminium Casing

nomifactory.quest.db.76.title=The First Tier Two Circuits
nomifactory.quest.db.76.desc=Your first §6Tier Two Circuits§r will require four §6Tier One Circuits§r plus a §6Diode§r made with §6Gallium§r to craft.%n%nThese are rather expensive... Always be on the lookout for a cheaper way to make your circuits- new sets of recipes become available each time you make a new tier of §3Assembling Machine§r.

# db 77
nomifactory.quest.db.77.title=Exquisite Gems
nomifactory.quest.db.77.desc=§6Exquisite Gems§r are mostly needed for crafting special materials.%n%nIf you don't need them for that though, they can be cut through two cycles in a §3Cutting Machine§r into eight of the basic version of that gem.

# db 78
nomifactory.quest.db.78.title=Gallium
nomifactory.quest.db.78.desc=Throwing §6Impure Piles of Sphalerite§r into Cauldrons is the first way of obtaining §6Sphalerite§r, which can be electrolyzed as a good source of §6Gallium§r. The §6Zinc§r and §6Sulfur§r you get from doing this will be quite useful as well. Sphalerite Ore§r spawns in §6Zinc§r veins. %n%nA §3Centrifuge§r instead of a Cauldron is slower and requires power, but it gets you more Gallium while separating the impure dust into Sphalerite.%n%nIf you're having trouble getting the quest to complete, check to see if you are holding §6small piles§r instead of §6tiny piles§r. If so, combine four small piles into a regular dust, then split that into tiny piles. A §3Worktable§r can help you quickly convert between pile types.

# db 79
nomifactory.quest.db.79.title=MV Cutting Machine
nomifactory.quest.db.79.desc=Cuts things up.%n%nThe §3Cutting Machine§r is able to cut wafers, rods, wood, and various other things for you, making it a versatile crafting tool. Cutting blocks into plates is fast and effective, and is the only way to get gem plates like §6Lapis Plates§r for now.%n%nThe blade will require you to make §6Cobalt Brass§r. Cobalt is a byproduct you will obtain (probably first as tiny piles through some simple ore processing), §6Zinc§r you should have already from electrolyzing §6Sphalerite§r, and the other materials are just §6Copper§r and §6Aluminium§r.%n%nCutting Machines work with plain §9Water§r for all recipes. You can also use §9Distilled Water§r which speeds up the processing somewhat, or §9Lubricant§r that speeds it up greatly. Right now though, the benefit is rather minor compared the extra effort required to make those fluids. Something to keep in mind for the future though.%n%nYou might consider waiting until you have §6Electronic Processors§r before progressing too far down the path of MV machines, since these circuits are much easier to make than §6Primitive Processors§r.

# db 80
nomifactory.quest.db.80.title=Silicon Boules
nomifactory.quest.db.80.desc=A hefty amount of §6Silicon Dust§r and a pinch of §6Gallium§r cooked in an §3EBF§r will net you a §6Silicon Boule§r, the starting point for §6Circuit Wafers§r.%n%nMake sure your power system is up to the task.

nomifactory.quest.db.81.title=Silicon Wafers
nomifactory.quest.db.81.desc=§6Wafers§r are thin pieces of silicon cut from a §6Silicon Boule§r.%n%nTheir primary purpose is engraving §6Circuit Wafers§r.%n%nYou'll be needing huge amounts of these Wafers for circuits. Silicon Boules currently take a very long time to craft, so consider parallelizing the recipe in multiple §3EBF§rs and making a stockpile of them.

# db 84
nomifactory.quest.db.84.title=Circuit Wafers
nomifactory.quest.db.84.desc=§6Circuit Wafers§r are batches of integrated circuits engraved onto a wafer of electronics-grade silicon.%n%nYou need to run these through the §3Cutting Machine§r to dice the wafers into individual integrated circuits (called dies).%n%nThese are important components and will be used for making more advanced Circuits.

nomifactory.quest.db.89.title=The First Tier Three Circuits
nomifactory.quest.db.89.desc=Your first tier three circuit, formed from four §6Electronic Processors§r and §6Transistors§r, among other ingredients.%n%nAs you'll realize is the pattern, it is expensive and unwieldy to make the first forms of each tier of circuits. Fortunately, you don't have to make many of them.%n%nPrioritize using these circuits to make things needed for unlocking the next theme of circuits, which require more infrastructure but are much cheaper to produce. Eventually each tier through six will have a circuit recipe instead of requiring processors, arrays, or mainframes.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.db.95.desc=§9Ethylene§r is a hydrocarbon made from dehydrating §9Ethanol§r with §9Sulfuric Acid§r in a §3Chemical Reactor§r. It is an extremely important chemical in the production of plastics.%n%n§9Polyethylene§r is the most common category of plastic, made from polymers of §9Ethylene§r. Adding §9Oxygen§r in a §3Chemical Reactor§r recreates (with some artistic license) early accidental synthesis of Polyethylene.%n%nWhen you have large amounts of §6Rutile§r and §6Bauxite§r (probably after you visit the Moon) you can consider using §9Titanium Tetrachloride§r as a catalyst to improve your Polyethylene yields.

nomifactory.quest.db.97.desc=If you didn't know, you can have stacks of items stored inside of an §aME Interface§r. Placing a §aStorage Bus§r onto the ME Interface lets you access and use those items in recipes. Putting a §aCrafting Card§r inside the Interface will let the Interface automatically place autocraft orders for items it should stock but you don't have.%n%nThis approach can be used for autocrafting to some extent, but proceed with caution as crafting cards can produce a great deal of lag on larger ME Networks. AE calculates the full crafting tree of these items every time a request is made, even if you have enough items already in stock.%n%nThus, it is strongly recommended to limit Crafting Cards to simple recipes (ones without many dependent recipes) and ideally on smaller purpose-built networks. %n%nPrefer passive autocrafting methods on your main network, or if things are gonna get complicated.

When you're ready to move on to HV recipes in the EBF, you'll want to move up to HV Energy Input Hatches, and so on.%n%nHowever, remember to keep the MV area seperate from your LV area. §eHooking up an LV machine to MV current will result in the machine being destroyed! Also LV cables will burn up if you put MV current through them§r. That's why its probably best to keep the areas separate until you're comfortable and confident with voltages. Eventually you can use transformers to switch voltages within a single setup, but don't feel forced to try that until you've got a grasp on the basics.%n%nAll RF power is the same (it has no voltages), so you can use RF conduits to route power from wherever you're generating and storing it to §3CEFs§r for each voltage. You don't have to use this setup, but its the most foolproof one for a beginner. And if you're an expert, well... you don't need my advice.%n%nFor your MV cables, you can use §6Copper§r to start with. §6Energetic Alloy cables§r are lossless though, so consider them if you're able to mass produce those ingots.

For the purposes of this particular quest, you'll be building a cheap breeder reactor to make §6Plutonium§r.%n%nFirst, set up your 54 §6Reactor Casings§r to encase a 3x3 cube shape of empty air. The Casings should only cover the faces of the interior cube, not the edges or corners. You should have exactly the right number of Casings to encase a 3x3 space.%n%nNext, create a hole so you can get inside the cube. Place the §6Reactor Cells§r in all 8 corners. Then the §6Lapis Coolers§r will go between them: 4 on the top layer and 4 on the bottom layer. At this point, the top and botom layers should have eight blocks each with an empty middle, and the middle layer is fully empty. In the middle layer, place the 4 §6Graphite Blocks§r on the corners, and the 4 §6Glowstone Coolers§r on the sides (so they touch both Lapis Coolers). Now the cube should be full, except for an empty column in the middle. The reactor will now be complete when you reseal it up with the Casings you removed to access the interior.%n%nFinally, place the §3Fission Reactor Controller§r along any edge or corner of the reactor. Opening the Reactor Controller GUI should let you know that the structure was properly formed; if not, go back and check what you did wrong.%n%nThe lever is placed on the reactor, as a redstone signal is required for it to start working. §cReactors can overheat and melt if the temperature exceeds its ability to cool.§r You can make a safety loop on the controller (instead of the lever) to automatically shut off the reactor when it starts getting hot using a §aRedstone Conduit§r, a §aRedstone Sensor Filter§r (on the input channel), and a §aRedstone NOT Filter§r (on the output channel).

nomifactory.quest.db.402.title=Machine Covers
nomifactory.quest.db.402.desc=GregTech adds a very versatile way of augmenting machines with §aMachine Covers§r. Covers are "upgrades" that you can put on any GregTech machine, chest, or drum to expand its functionality. To work with covers, you'll need to make yourself a §aScrewdriver§r to configure covers, and a §aCrowbar§r to remove covers without having to break the machine.%n%nHere's a quick list of what covers there are in the game, and what they do:%n%n- §a§lFilter§r: controls what items can enter or leave through a particular side, with 9 configurable slots and whitelist/blacklist modes. You can also put a filter into a §aConveyor§r or §aRobotic Arm§r to customize what items they will move. There's also a §9Fluid§r variant of the filter, which offers the same controls and can be placed in §aPumps§f.%n%n- §a§lOre Dictionary Filter§r: a specialized filter that uses ore dictionary entries and supports "*" as a wildcard, e. g. "§6ingotHot*§r" will match all hot ingots, and "§6dustTiny*§r" will match all tiny piles.%n%n- §a§lConveyor§r: transfers items to or from an adjacent inventory.%n%n- §a§lRobotic Arm§r: is much like §aConveyor§r, but has two additional modes: §6Keep Exact§r, which keeps the exact amount of items in the inventory, and §6Supply Exact§r which transfers the exact amount of items per operation (useful for packaging tiny piles when used with §aOre Dictionary Filter§f!). This cover is very useful for crafting automation.%n%n- §a§lPump§r: is much like a §aConveyor§f, but for fluids.%n%n- §a§lShutter§r: prevents any interactions with a side.%n%n- §a§lMachine Controller§r: enables or disables a machine and/or its covers depending on whether it is receiving a redstone signal. Useful when paired with §6ME level emitters§f to keep resources in stock.

You'll have to choose the appropriate table for the recipe you want to encode.%n%n§6Holders§r must be encoded in pairs: one for the Packager, and one for the Unpackager. Select the appropriate table for the recipe, look up the recipe you want to encode, and press §6[+]§r in §bJEI§r to fill it in. Put two Holders in the top-left slot and press Save to encode the recipe to both of them. Finally, put each Holder into the respective machines.%n%nIf you've done everything correctly, you should see the item appear as craftable in a Terminal.%n%nWhile it might seem that the crafting process is slow, §ePackagedAuto is excellent at parallelizing§r.

nomifactory.quest.db.727.desc=When you first started the pack, we told you that ore doubling can wait, and that's true... But you will need to start doing some rudimentary ore processing for §ebyproducts§r.%n%nByproducts are additional materials that can only be obtained from processing ores in certain machines. For example, there is no "Gallium Ore". You get §6Gallium§r as a byproduct from processing other ores.%n%nOres have various means of processing, and eventually you'll use machine pipelines to process ores in specific ways to optimize what byproducts you gain. You can walk through JEI to figure out the path you want for each ore (always look for machine sources of small and tiny piles too).%n%nThe relevant machines are as follows:%n %n- §3Macerator§r: turns ores into §6Crushed Ores§r, Crushed Ores into §6Impure Dusts§r, and §6Purified Crushed Ores§r into §6Pure Dusts§r. Higher tiers of macerators have byproduct slots and gain a chance to get a full pile of byproduct from ores and both types of crushed ores.%n%n- §3Washer§r: cleans Crushed Ores with §9Water§r, making Purified Crushed Ores§r, and a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct. Using §9Distilled Water§r makes them go faster. This is an improved alternative to dropping dusts in a Cauldron.%n%n- §3Chemical Bath§r: similar to a washer, but uses chemicals to purify the crushed ores. Has a chance to give a full pile of byproducts, often different than what the Washer would give.%n%n- §3§3Centrifuge§r: separates Pure or Impure dusts into the final material, producing a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct.%n%n- §3Electrolyzer§r: uses power to split compounds into individual elements, sometimes gaining useful byproducts in the proces.%n%nThe §3Thermal Centrifuge§r, not to be confused with the regular Centrifuge, can be used for alternative ore processing but is §edreadfully slow and power-hungry§r. No LV form exists, and its primary use is for §bNuclearCraft§r fission fuels.%n%nYour first forays into ore processing for byproducts will be the Electrolyzer and the Centrifuge.%n

nomifactory.quest.db.728.desc=§6Uraninite Ore§r is the first source of §6Pulsating Dust§r but is not a very good one in the long term. Instead you should make §6Resonant Clathrates§r, which are an infinitely-renewable and effective source of Pulsating Dust.%n%nResonant Clathrates are made by melting §6Ender Pearls§r with a §3Fluid Extractor§r into §9Resonant Ender§r, then mixing that with §6Nether Quartz§r in an MV or better §3Chemical Reactor§r. Smelting this clathrate gives Pulsating Dust.%n%nWith Resonant Clathrates now accessible, everything you need for crafting §6Pulsating Polymer Clay§r can be automated in a net-positive loop.§r Doing so is a boon to automation of §bDeep Mob Learning§r, which is §ea primary source of important materials for the rest of the pack§r.%n%nThe exact implementation is up to you.

You can use §aPump covers§r on §bGregTech§r machines to pull fluids from or extract fluids into an interface. This is useful for routing fluids if you're already using the output side for items or a different fluid.%n%nIt is also far more performant and scales better without lag than §aFluid Import/Export Buses§r.

# db 730
nomifactory.quest.db.730.title=Fluids and Autocrafting
nomifactory.quest.db.730.desc=Working with fluids is a bit tricky. There's no equivalent to §aRobot Arms§r for fluids, meaning routing precise quantities of fluids is not feasible. AE2 §aPatterns§r have no notion of fluids, meaning that you have to §ededicate separate machines to specific fluid combinations§r, ensuring they remain stocked.%n%nAE2 has a §aFluid Import Bus§r and §aFluid Export Bus§r, and this is the usual go-to for players experienced with AE2. A §aCapacity Card§r will let you export or import five specific chemicals through a single bus, which is enough for, say, §3Chemical Reactors§r. However, §cexcessive use of AE2 buses will cause lag§r.%n%nA better approach for §bGregTech§r machines is using a stocked §aFluid Interface§r and a §aPump cover§r. This works almost identically to passive autocrafting with Robot Arms, and using §aFluid Filters§r with the pumps can allow routing up to six distinct fluids to adjacent machines. This method is much more performant, scaling without causing lag like buses. For other mods, you can route fluids from a Fluid Interface with conduits.%n%n

# db 731
nomifactory.quest.db.731.title=Fluid Logistics
nomifactory.quest.db.731.desc=Your §3Chemical Reactors§r will be making a lot of different fluids. You'll need to manage the logistics of routing and storing all the different fluids you're automating.%n%nWherever possible, having one Chemical Reactor output directly into another machine that needs its output chemical saves you from having to figure out additional storage and routing. §aFluid Filters§r and §aPump covers§r are very useful for moving fluids around a compact processing pipeline.%n%nBut what about the final output fluids that you need elsewhere?%n%nOne option is to use the output tanks of the Chemical Reactors as a small storage buffer, letting it back up and stop crafting automatically. A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.%n%nThere's some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won't be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn't try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn't have room for all fluid outputs§r.%n%nWhen you get access to them, it's probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces. You can fill up the cells, then pull the fluids out wherever else you need them.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.db.743.title=Use JEI! Use JEI! USE. JEI.
nomifactory.quest.db.743.desc=§e§eUSE JEI!!!%n%n§bJEI§f stands for §bJust Enough Items§r. It's the list of all items that you see every time you open your inventory. It's the better(tm) recipe book that shows you all available items and recipes in the modpack.%n%nTo see it in action, pull up a quest that requires an item of some sort and just click the item!%n%nIf you want to know how to craft an item, just hover your mouse over it and press §6R§r. JEI will list all available recipes.%n%nIf you instead want to know what recipes use an item, hover over it and press §6U§r.%n%nHover over an item and press §6A§r to bookmark it. To remove a bookmarked item from the list, press A on the bookmark.%n%nOne of the remarkable features of JEI is that it's also capable of helping you with recipes. Right-click a crafting table, look up the recipe you need and press the §a[+]§r button: if you have all required items for the recipe, this will put them all into the crafting table for you.

# db 744
nomifactory.quest.db.744.title=Multi-Layer Fiber-Reinforced Epoxy Substrate
nomifactory.quest.db.744.desc=That's a lot of foil.%n%nThese boards are required for §6Quantum§r and §6Crystal Circuits§r, as well as the future basis of §6Wetware Lifesupport Circuit Boards§r. These will get you from tier four to tier eight.

# db 745
nomifactory.quest.db.745.title=Signalum
nomifactory.quest.db.745.desc=Not glowing.%n%nThis one takes a significant amount of time to cook, so make sure to have it going constantly.%n%n§6Signalum§r is noteworthy as the long-awaited next tier upgrade for your §bThermal Expansion§r machines and dynamos following "Reinforced" back in MV.

# db 746
nomifactory.quest.db.746.title=Compactor
nomifactory.quest.db.746.desc=A very power-efficient, if slow before upgrades, means of creating plates. Also the only way to directly make plates from single gems.%n%nUpgrading the machine tier with §aUpgrade Kits§r and applying §aAugments§r to boost its crafting speed is a good idea.%n%nPlates and Platings that are gated specifically by later §bGregTech§r voltage tiers are not craftable in these (instead requiring a §3Compressor§r), but almost every single-ingredient recipe made in a Compressor is available.

# db 747
nomifactory.quest.db.747.title=Dark Steel Enchanter
nomifactory.quest.db.747.desc=Vanilla enchanting mechanics are just so tedious. Don't you wish you could just make a specific enchant instead of grinding levels and rolling the dice?%n%n§eOh wait- you can!§r%n%nThe §3Dark Steel Enchanter§r is a device that uses §6Book and Quill§r, experience levels, lapis, and enchant-specific items to create an §6Enchanted Book§r with an enchantment of your choosing. Then you can just use an Anvil to enchant your item like usual.%n%nThis is a good time to bring up the §dHolding§r enchant, which can be applied to most items from §bThermal Foundation§r and its related mods. Holding can be crafted up to level IV, which massively boosts the storage capacity of items like §aSatchels§r, §aFlux Capacitors§r, and §aPortable Tanks§r.%n%nYou can also make the §dMending§r enchant which allows you to infinitely repair the item when damaged using §9Liquid XP§r in an §bEnderIO §aFluid Tank§r or §aPressurized Fluid Tank§r.%n%n

# db 748
nomifactory.quest.db.748.title=Gearworking Die
nomifactory.quest.db.748.desc=A §3Compactor§r§r§r specialized to a §aGear Press§r is a very power efficient way to make gears. It is slower than its overclocking GTCE counterparts, but is required for some gears, most notably the crystal and gemstone ones.%n%nLike all §aAugments§r, the Gear Press specialization takes up an upgrade slot, but you can still use the rest of the slots for other ones like speed upgrades.

# db 749
nomifactory.quest.db.749.title=Fusion Reactor MK2
nomifactory.quest.db.749.desc=Upgrade time! %n...or building a new one, which is probably better.%n%nYet again this quest asks for the minimal number of casings. Make an extra 28 if you don't want more than §a2 Fluid Inputs§r§r and §a1 Fluid Output§r.%n%nIf you insist on upgrading instead of making a new one, don't dismantle the current one before you're sure you've got everything you need to upgrade it, or you might end up having to rebuild the §3Mark 1 Fusion Reactor§r again.%n%nThe §3Mark 2 Fusion Reactor§r has an energy buffer of §e320M EU§r.

# db 750
nomifactory.quest.db.750.title=Enderium Ingot
nomifactory.quest.db.750.desc=A complex material from §bThermal Expansion§r cooked in an §3Electric Blast Furnace§r.%n%n§6Enderium§r doesn't require much power (running on as little as MV) but it does need a lot of heat and is incredibly slow without overclocking.%n%nAs with all later blast furnace materials, dedicate a furnace to keeping these in stock and have it running constantly to ensure a stable supply (turning it off when you have an acceptably vast stockpile).

# db 751
nomifactory.quest.db.751.title=Infinitest Water
nomifactory.quest.db.751.desc=§3Aqueous Accumulators§r in §5Nomifactory§r are infinite water sources; they §l§ndo not§r require any water blocks nearby.%n%nThis machine can produce §9Water§r as fast as you can extract it (the only downside being that it makes some annoying noises).%n%nFriendship with §aEndervoirs§r ended.

# db 752
nomifactory.quest.db.752.title=Boilers and Turbines
nomifactory.quest.db.752.desc=Using plain §3Steam Dynamos§f is pretty inefficient.%n%nIt's strongly recommended to make §aaugments§r. With these, you can turn one Steam Dynamo into a §3steam boiler§f, and two other Steam Dynamos into §3steam turbines§f. The ratio is always §a1:2§r if all Dynamos are equally upgraded.%n%nThis greatly increases the overall efficiency and the amount of power produced, from §a40 RF/t§r per basic steam dynamo to §a320 RF/t§r per set of three augmented dynamos.

nomifactory.quest.db.754.title=Telepad
nomifactory.quest.db.754.desc=Before you travel to the Moon, you'll want to set up a way to easily return.%n%nLay out nine of the §6Telepad Blocks§r in a 3x3 pattern. They should turn into a multiblock. While having some §6Paper§r in your inventory, use the §aCoordinate Selector§r to create a §6Location Printout§r of an area near the Telepad. Keep track of this Printout and make sure to bring it with you to the Moon!%n%nMake sure the Telepad on the Overworld is ready to go. It needs power, a tank of §9Dew of the Void§r, and the chunk it's in needs to be §eChunkloaded§r. Bring the other nine Telepad Blocks with you when you go to the Moon, and once there, set up a similar layout. The one on the Moon will also need power, Dew of the Void and its chunk loaded. Consider making a solar panel and a capacitor bank to keep it powered.%n%nOnce your Moon Telepad is up and running, put your Overworld coordinates into it. Then record your current location on the Moon with the Coordinate Selector. Teleport home, and put those coordinates into the Overworld Telepad. Now you can travel back and forth easily!%n%nYou might consider building a room dedicated to Telepad transit, both on the Overworld and to other Planets, and label them. You'll be visiting many other worlds soon enough.

nomifactory.quest.db.755.title=Inspector Gadget
nomifactory.quest.db.755.desc=This pack has §bBuilding Gadgets§r.%n%nThese devices can help you build, swap blocks, destroy massive areas, or even copy-paste regions. You need the blocks you plan to paste in your inventory though; it doesn't make them from nothing.%n%nAlso important to note that it won't work with TileEntities, so it pretty much only works with simple blocks (not stuff like machines).%n%nBy default, the config GUI is bound to §6G§r.

nomifactory.quest.db.757.desc=You may have noticed that The End portals in Strongholds are disabled.%n%nThe only way to access The End is to... §ebake a cake§r. You can refill it with §6Eyes of Ender§r.%n%nPrepare some gear, eat a slice, and get ready for a fight!

# db 758
nomifactory.quest.db.758.title=Egg Thief
nomifactory.quest.db.758.desc=Find a clever way to make the Ender Dragon's Egg to fall onto a torch. This neat trick will turn it into a collectible item so you can bring it home with you.%n%nYou might be interested in getting yourself a §3Dragon Egg Mill§r to place it on for free 500 GP.

# db 759
nomifactory.quest.db.759.title=Fire Water
nomifactory.quest.db.759.desc=§9Fire Water§r is a great way of producing §6Grains of Infinity§r. Spill a bucket over a patch of bare bedrock and watch it drop grains every so often. There's a 2%% chance per random tick for one to be generated on each block of bedrock the Fire Water is flowing on.%n%nMake sure to chunkload the area.

# db 760
nomifactory.quest.db.760.title=The Outer Islands
nomifactory.quest.db.760.desc=Now that you've dealt with the dragon, seek the bedrock structure floating mid-air around the edge of the main island.%n%nCarefully throw an §6Ender Pearl§r inside one (where there's a portal-looking texture) to teleport to a distant island.%n%nOnce there, gather some §6Chorus Flowers§r. You'll have to smash the flower itself to get it: simply breaking the stem of a plant will not drop the flower.%n%nAnd finally, obtain some §6Draconium Dust§r. Its ore spawns in small quantities, but should be everywhere.%n%nTo get back to the main island, throw an Ender Pearl into another bedrock portal structure.%n%n

# db 761
nomifactory.quest.db.761.title=Thinking with Dislocators
nomifactory.quest.db.761.desc=§6Dislocator Pedestals§f are a very simple way of inter-dimensional transport.%n%nHold a §6Dislocator§f in your hand and §6sneak-right click§f to bind it to your position. Now, place it inside a Pedestal so you can travel to the bound spot anytime you want.%n%nBefore going to the Moon, you'll need §etwo Dislocators§f and §etwo Pedestals§f.%n%nBind one Dislocator to a location in the Overworld, then take it with you to the Moon and put it down on a Pedestal.%n%nBind the other Dislocator to a location on the Moon, then use the first Pedestal to return home. Place the second Dislocator on the second Pedestal, then you can warp between the two locations at will. Neat!%n%n§aTip: Dislocators don't lose durability on use when placed in a Pedestal!

# db 762

nomifactory.quest.db.774.desc=Whether or not you (or your server admin) picked the default §bLost Cities§r overworld type, you have the option of teleporting yourself to the §eLost Cities Dimension§r. This is useful if you like other world types but want to still be able to explore cities for things like §eloot and spawners§r§r.%n%nTo create a portal, you must place a §aBed§r§r down on two §6Blocks of Diamond§r. Then, you surround the bed with any kind of §eMonster Skulls§r. Sleep in this bed and you will be teleported there.%n%n§cDon't forget to have a way to get back!§r§r You can use the §e/sethome§r§r command to register where your house is, and §e/home§r§r to return to it. If you supply a name (default "home") then you can register and go to multiple locations. There are some §erestrictions§r on this though: §eit takes a few seconds of standing still to activate§r and there is a §ecooldown§r between uses.%n%nLater on you'll have other means of teleportation.%n%nMonster Skulls might take a little while to get if you're playing in §ePeaceful§r§r. §6Skeleton Skulls§r would be the way to go in that case.
