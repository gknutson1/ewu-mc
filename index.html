<h2 id="requirements">System Requirements</h2>
    <p>To join the Server, you must have a computer capable of running Minecraft Java Edition 1.12.2. In general, you will need a computer with an x86-64 processor, running either Windows, Linux, or MacOS, although other OSes may work. It is reccommended to have at least 8 gigs of RAM. This tutorial is primarily for Windows users, so users of other OSes may need to modify these instructions as they see fit.</p>
<h2 id="java">Installing Java</h2>
    <p>The server requires Java 8, preferrably the most recent version (8u311 at the time of writing). To install Java, go to <a href="https://java.com/en/download/">java.com/en/download</a> and select &quot;Agree and Start Free Download&quot;. Once the download has completed, Run the installer and follow all of it's prompts.</p>
<h2 id="multimc">Installing MultiMC</h2>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://multimc.org">multimc.org</a> and scroll down until you find the "downloads" section. Select the button marked &quot;Download (32/64-bit)&quot; under the Windows logo. This will download a file labled &quot;mmc-stable-win32.zip&quot;. Extract the files in this folder to wherever you wish to install minecraft to. Then start MultiMC by opening the folder you just extracted, and starting the program &quot;MultiMC.exe&quot;.</p>
    <p>When you first open MultiMC, you may get a warning from Windows SmartScreen saying that the program is not signed. Simply click &quot;more info&quot; and then &quot;Run Anyway&quot;. MultiMC will then ask you to select your language. Do so. Next, you need to select your Java version and memory allocation settings. For java, select a version of java that has an architecture of 64 and a version number of 1.8.0_xxx, where the x's are any number. For memory allocation, if you have 10 GB of RAM or more, allocate 8 GB in the box marked &quot;Maximum memory allocation&quot;. If you have less than 10 GB of ram, subtract 2 GB from the ammount of RAM you have, and allocate that much. If you have less than 6 GB of RAM, you may run into issues running the modpack. Once you have set the memory allocation, select &quot;Next&quot;. MultiMC will ask you if you wish to Enable Analytics. You can chose to enable or disable Analytics, and thenclick &quot;Finish&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="account">Signing In</h2>
    <p>Now that you are in MultiMC, select the button marked &quot;Settings&quot; at the top of the MultiMC UI, and then select &quot;Accounts&quot; in the window that pops up.</p>
    <h3 id="mojang">&emsp;Mojang Account</h3>
        <p>&emsp;If you have a Mojang account (you bought Minecraft through mojang.com and have NOT yet migrated your account), select &quot;Add Mojang&quot;, and input your username and password, and hit OK.</p>
    <h3 id="microsoft">&emsp;Microsoft Account</h3>
        <p>&emsp;If you have a Microsoft account (you bought Minecraft through Minecraft.net, or migrated your Mojang account), Select &quot;Add Microsoft&quot;. A window will appear with a URL and a 8 digit code. Open the URL and input the 8 digit code into the website you just opened. In the website, click next, and then follow the prompts to sign in to your Microsoft account. A message will appear in the site asking you to grant MultiMC access to your Microsoft account. Select yes to finish signing in.</p>
<h2 id="modpack">Installing the Modpack</h2>
    <p>go to <a href="https://github.com/gknutson1/ewu-mc/releases/latest">github.com/gknutson1/ewu-minecraft-server/releases/latest</a> and download the file labled EWU.CS.Modpack.vXX.zip, where XX is some number. Go back to MultiMC and select &quot;Add Instance&quot; in the upper left corner of the window. In the window that pops up, select &quot;import from zip&quot;, and then &quot;browse&quot;. Slelect the zip file you just downloaded, and then select &quot;ok&quot;. MultiMC will take a minute to unpack the folder, and you will then see the modpack in the main multiMC screen. Now you can simply hit the &quot;launch&quot; button on the right side of the screen to start playing!</p>
