        This page is here to instruct you on how to install the EWU Minecraft CS Modpack. This site is still very much a work in progress, so please be paitent. If you wish to contribute, you can find the source code at the 'site' branch at <a href="https://github.com/gknutson1/ewu-mc/">github.com/gknutson1/ewu-mc</a>. You can also find the source code for the modpack there if you want to roll your own version of the pack or contribute to improving the pack.

        The server has a Discord! The discord is where we announce updates, coordinate events, and talk with other players. Join at <a href="https://discord.gg/TE2bvDM5/">discord.gg/TE2bvDM5</a>.

        This modpack is formatted as a CurseForge pack. This guide shows how to use the CurseForge launcher to install and manage the modpack, but any Minecraft launcher that supports CurseForge modpacks, such as MultiMC, should work. You can download the latest version of the pack from the <a href="">CurseForge page<a> or <a href="https://github.com/gknutson1/ewu-minecraft-server/releases/latest">GitHub repo</a>.

        This guide assumes you have zero experience with modded Minecraft and tries to be as detailed as possible. If you have some experience with modded Minecraft, you may only neeed to skim this guide or not need to use it at all.

        To join the Server, you must have a computer capable of running Minecraft Java Edition 1.12.2. In general, you will need a computer with an x86-64 processor, running either Windows, Linux, or MacOS, although other OSes may work. It is reccommended to give the modpack at least 4 GB of RAM, so ideally you should have 8 GB of RAM. However, the modpack can run on computers with as little as 4 GB of RAM. This tutorial is primarily for Windows users, so users of other OSes may need to modify these instructions as they see fit.

        Go to <a href="https://download.curseforge.com/">download.curseforge.com</a> and download the version for your operating system. Run the installer and follow the steps. It is recommended you check 'Create a desktop shortuct for CurseForge' as CurseForge is what we need to install the modpack. You will need to agree to the privacy policy, and after the process has completed, you will be able to launch CurseForge. Launch CurseForge and either skip the intro with the 'Skip Intro' button or follow the intro.

        Now that you are in CurseForge, you should see a number of tiles representing different games. Click 'Minecraft', and then 'Continue'. CurseForge will then drop you to a screen that says 'No profile currently installed'. Enter 'EWU MC' into the top search bar, and you should see the modpack appear. Click the button marked 'Install'. Then wait for the install to finish. You can now click Play. The Minecraft launcher will start, and may have to install or update itself. Once it is done with any updates, it may prompt you to sign in to your account. If it does, follow its prompts to complete the sign in. You should now be dropped into the main launcher screen, and should have a large green 'PLAY' button at the bottom of the screen. Press that, and a box warning you that the game is modified will appear. Check the box labeled 'Don't warn me again' and press play to continue. The launcher will need to download a few files, and then the Modpack will launch.
